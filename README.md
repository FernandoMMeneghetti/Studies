# Studies
#This is where I'll keep my study log and plan.

#I have previously coded in HTML, CSS, JavaSCript, C++ and VBA but for a long time my only practice has been some macros for Excel for engeneering or personal use. Now I have decieded to switch gears and move to full time programmer so I'll have to update my knowledge.

#I have bought a couple of online courses and have a few more free courses lined up but my goal is to finish the base first and then move on to a specific area like front, back or full-stack (TBD).

#The first part of my journey begins with the B7Web course. Git, GitHUb, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
